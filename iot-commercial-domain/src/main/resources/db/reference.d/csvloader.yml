# Sample data

# All tables:
#  * table - name of the table to populate
#  * file - name of csv file to read data from
#  * columns (list) - list of columns in the table if it can not be guessed from csvheader (optional*)
#  * primaryKey - name of the primary key in the table if it is not the first column (optional*)
#  * csvheader - true or false, overrides the default (optional)
#  * emptyIsNull - true or false, overrides the default (optional)
#  * otherNullValues - if need to override the default (optional)
#
# Note on columns:
# The columns are deduced from the csvheader if there is one by some simple rules. Spaces and dashes (-) are
# converted to underscore, camelCase is converted to snake_case and the name is trimmed. In cases where the csvheader
# is absent or the columns can not be deduced in this way or if the columns are not all of type string it becomes
# necessary to specify the columns manually.
# To specify the type of a column simply append a colon and the type to the name so instead "display_order"
# use "display_order:int". The csvloader does the following type conversions:
#  * "int", "integer" -> Integer::parseInt
#  * "long" -> Long::parseLong
#  * "bool", "boolean" -> Boolean::parseBoolean
#  * "real", "float" -> Float::parseFloat
#  * "double" -> Double::parseDouble
#  * "str", "string" -> s -> s
# If no type is specified string is assumed.
#
# Note on primaryKey:
# Knowing the primary key becomes necessary if the first column is not the primary key for the case where a file is
# changed and the csvloader runs in "REFRESH" mode.
#
defaults:
  # Default config for the tables in this set. Can be overridden pr table.

  # If true the first line is a header and the loader will try to guess column names from this
  # If false "columns" is mandatory for every table
  csvheader: true

  # An empty value (ie. the empty string) is interpreted as null
  emptyIsNull: true

  # These values are also recognized and set to null on insert
  otherNullValues: ["null", "<null>"]

tables:

  - table: iot_event_type
    file: ioteventtypecodes.csv
